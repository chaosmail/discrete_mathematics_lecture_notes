\section{History of this document}

This document was started by students of Discrete Mathematics in the winter semester 2013.
The discussion for this collaboration can be found at the \href

{\nolinkurl{Informatik Forum}}. The source code for the WS13 project was hosted at 
\href{https://bitbucket.org/neroburner/discrete_mathematics_vo_2013ws.git}{Bitbucket}.
The current version (WS2014) of the document is hosted at \href{https://github.com/woife/discrete_mathematics_lecture_notes}{Github}.

I (Wolfgang Wallner) plan to improve this document during the upcoming term (WS2014). If anyone would like to help, feel free to contact me via \href{mailto:wolfgang-wallner@gmx.at}{wolfgang-wallner@gmx.at}.
