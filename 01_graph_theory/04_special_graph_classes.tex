\subsection*{Eulerian Graphs}

\begin{definition}
An \dt{Eulerian trail}, which can be open or closed, is a trail where no edge is repeated and every edge is used. In a closed trail or \dt{Eulerian tour}, start = end.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A graph is called \dt{Eulerian} if there is an Eulerian tour.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Theorem.}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected, connected multigraph. Then
\[
  G\text{ is Eulerian} \iff \forall x\in V: d(x)\text{ even}.
\]

There is an \emph{open} Eulerian trail $\iff$ exactly two vertices have odd degree.

\textbf{Proof.}
% "<==" direction
Proof by induction on $\alpha_1(G) =: m$.

$m = 0$: Trivial, only one vertex.

$m â‰¥ 1$: construct a tour $W$. You can always find a tour because degrees are even, thus every time you enter a vertice you can certainly find an edge where you can leave it.

Two cases:
a) $W$ is an Eulerian tour
b) $W$ is not an Eulerian tour

Then remove $W$, resulting in a graph $G'$ with connected components $G'_1$,~\ldots Then
\[
    \forall x\in V(G'_{i}): d_{G'}(x)\text{ is still even}
\]

Since all $G'_{i}$ are smaller than $G$, we can apply the induction hypothesis. This means $G'_{i}$ must be Eulerian (with Eulerian tours $W_{i}$.

$\forall i: W_i$ and $W$ have common vertex. Thus you can construct an Eulerian tour for the whole graph.
